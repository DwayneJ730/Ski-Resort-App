Ski Resort
Project Description
The Ski Resort Application allows users to view offered services, make or cancel a booking, or view available supplies and booking dates. The Application takes advantage of the built in form calendar to showcase what dates can be booked. A user can dynamically add party members to their trip or choose to go solo. They can apply different services to either the group or individuals in the group. Every service and product has been priced, available with discounts when purchased in bulk. A total estimated price is shown at the end of each step in the booking process and a final price at the end of purchase before the user’s final confirmation.

Booking Process - Allows a user to book a trip and pre-pay for all the activities they wish to enjoy on the trip. They can cancel at anytime. The forms autosave so a user can leave and come back later to finish their booking.
